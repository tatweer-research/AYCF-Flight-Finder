Hey there! ‚úàÔ∏èüëã

Attached is the report with the WizzAir flights I managed to dig up for you. If it‚Äôs empty... well, either WizzAir is taking a nap, or you're just too picky! üòÖ

We‚Äôd love to hear what you think about our little hobby app‚Äîit‚Äôs like our baby, but with fewer diapers and more code. üíªüçº
